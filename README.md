# my-auto-install-bash-scripts
*My auto-installs scripts for  osint, bugbounty, pentesting*

# Example:

*Photon*<br /> 
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon.git
cd Photon && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt



To gain some time and avoid boring installations, I use these shell scripts for quick installations for VM's for my CyberLabs.

Default path is : home='cd /opt' 
*Or anywhere as you wish. To keep tidy, /opt is better, in my opinion. You can choose /Downloads and mkdir Tools, etc :)*
